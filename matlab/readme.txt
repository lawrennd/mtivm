This is the MT-IVM toolbox. 

Unfortunately the software here will not recreate the experiments in the ICML paper as, due to the anonymous submission procedure I failed to freeze the code after submission. My apologies for this.

The original ICML version relied on old IVM code that predates the version on the web. This version relies on the new IVM toolbox which is a lot more modular.

This code relies on the IVM toolbox vs 0.31. You can use your username and password to download this toolbox from http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~neil/ivm/downloadFiles/vrs0p31.
