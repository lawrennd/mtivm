<h1>MT-IVM Software</h1>

This page describes examples of how to use the Multi-task IVM Software (MT-IVM) available for <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/neill-bin/software/downloadForm.cgi?toolbox=mtivm">download here</a>. 

RELEASEINFORMATION

Fixes to icmlVowelDemo.

<h3>Version 0.141</h3>

<p>This release is simply a freshen up to get plots ready for talks in Madrid.

<h4>Release 0.14</h4>
<p>This release cleans up some missing dependencies and bugs pointed out by Kervin Murphy.

<p>Unfortunately the software here will not recreate the experiments in the ICML paper as, due to the anonymous submission procedure I failed to freeze the code after submission. My apologies for this.

<p>The original ICML version relied on old IVM code that predates the version on the web. This version relies on the new IVM toolbox which is a lot more modular.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h2><code>demToySine</code></h2>

<p>The first example given is <code>demToySine</code> which is a simple multi-task Gaussian Process Regression data set, using three sine waves with different phases. The input sampling distribution is different for each `task'. This means the tasks contain differing amounts of information.

<p>The result of learning is shown below, active points are circled.

Regression from the <code>demToySine.m</code> example. Data is shown as crosses. Circled crosses are points selected for the active set.</center>
